# TypeScript For React Developers

> N.B. I will continue updating this repository until Tuesday evening, so please make sure you run `git pull` and `pnpm install` on Wednesday, if you follow these instructions before then.

Before the workshop, please make sure you:

1. Download and install the latest LTS release of node from https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Install VSCode from https://code.visualstudio.com (you can use another editor if you prefer but this is the one I use)
3. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/typescript-for-react-developers.git`
4. Open the repository's root directory in VSCode (or your editor of choice)
5. Open a terminal in the repository's root directory (you can do this within VSCode using the "Terminal" -> "New Terminal" menu option, or use your preferred terminal app).
6. In the terminal, run `corepack enable` to tell node.js to use corepack to select the right package manager.
7. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies.
8. Run `pnpm prepared`. If you've done everything right, you should see a URL like `http://localhost:5173` and opening that URL should show a web page with the text "Welcome to TypeScript for React Developers".

If you can run all these steps in advance, it will save a lot of time during the workshop. If you run into any issues, please let me know as soon as possible so I can help you get setup before we start the workshop.

I recommend you don't look through the exercises or answers in advance. Just come to the workshop ready to learn. I look forward to seeing you in Alicante.

> P.S. I also recommend installing the [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en).
